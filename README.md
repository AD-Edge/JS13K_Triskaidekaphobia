# JS13K Post-Mortem [The Anti-Poker Protocol] --- (WIP)

## The Beginning

Heres a breakdown of the 31 days of dev which went into creating this entry, a 13kb-limited mostly-javascript game for the js13k gamejam.

This was my 4th time participating in the js13k gamejam, and (spoilers) I finally found myself with an end result worth submitting!
